# Stretch Reminder Application

## Description
This is a PyQt5-based GUI application that serves as a stretch reminder. The application periodically sends desktop notifications to remind the user to take a break and stretch. It allows the user to set the reminder intervals through a user-friendly interface.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/PersonalBeast/Stretch-Reminder.git`
2. Install the necessary dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the application: `python main.py`

## Usage

The application provides four buttons to set the stretch reminder interval:

- 15 minutes
- 30 minutes
- 60 minutes
- Custom (lets the user input their preferred interval)

Once the interval is set, the application will send a desktop notification to remind the user to stretch. The user can stop the reminders at any time by pressing the "Stop" button.
